Kartalnik
made by innate

Purpose: 
Made with the purpose to learn web design: html, css and JavaScript.
It is meant to be a bigger project with plenty of opportunities to get really complicated. 

Ideas: 
- main site with redirections to different games
- sites for games, that have descriptions, rules, widget for tracking scores, maybe more

Games: 
- tarok
- Å¡nops
- enka
- cambio
- generic scoreboard
- ...


TO DO: 
- main site
- design (dark and light themes)
- sites for games
- score widgets
  - easy input
  - fast input
  - logging rounds

Optimistic: 
- playable games
- multiple language support (don't mind switching between english and slovenian till then)
- users can create an account

Really optimistic:
- playable games

Just ideas that will never happen: 
- counting cards with image recognition
- AI to play against
- people actually using it
